# Analyze technical debt

Explore and analyze the code and surface areas of technical debt. Create a concise report of the areas that need improvement.

Focus on architectural debt, such as:

- Tight coupling between components/modules that should not be coupled
- Dependency structures that require changes in many places for simple things
- Inconsistent places for type and interface definitions
- Incohesive module structure

For each area of technical debt, give a 1-2 sentence proposal of how to resolve it
